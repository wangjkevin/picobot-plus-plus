# Welcome to Picobot++! ü§èüëæ

Picobot++ is an improved version of [Picobot](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/picobot/) from Harvey Mudd College, adding functionality for so-called _hashtag commands_.
Hashtag commands allow for programmatic control of Picobot's environment without having to manually click on each cell.

‚û°Ô∏è To add a `Wall` cell at row `X` and column `Y`, use the following command:
```
# add (X,Y)
```
‚û°Ô∏è To delete a `Wall` cell at row `X` and column `Y`, use the following command:
```
# sub (X,Y)
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Note that there isn't a space between `X` and `Y`. ‚ö†Ô∏è

There are also special _star_ commands, a subset of the hashtag commands. These commands allow you to draw and delete entire lines on the grid.

‚≠ê To add a line of `Wall` cells on row `X`, use the following command:
```
# add (X,*)
```
To delete a line on row `X`, use the same command, replacing `add` with `sub`.

‚≠ê To add a line of `Wall` cells on column `Y`, use the following command:
```
# add (*,Y)
```
To delete a line on row `Y`, use the same command, replacing `add` with `sub`.

You can think of the * as "anything", taking inspiration from RegExes :)

To run Picobot++, simply clone the respository using `git clone` and open up the `html` file. We hope you'll have fun guiding Picobot through even weirder, more bizarre worlds! üéâ

_üôå Many thanks to Prof. Zachary Dodds and many others for the original implementation of Picobot! üôå_
