# Welcome to Picobot++! 🤏👾

Picobot++ is an improved version of [Picobot](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/picobot/) from Harvey Mudd College, adding functionality for so-called _hashtag commands_.
Hashtag commands allow for programmatic control of Picobot's environment without having to manually click on each cell.

➡️ To add a `Wall` cell at row `X` and column `Y`, use the following command:
```
# add (X,Y)
```
➡️ To delete a `Wall` cell at row `X` and column `Y`, use the following command:
```
# sub (X,Y)
```
⚠️ Note that there isn't a space between `X` and `Y`. ⚠️

To run Picobot++, simply clone the respository using `git clone` and open up the `html` file. We hope you'll have fun guiding Picobot through even weirder, more bizarre worlds! 🎉

_🙌 Many thanks to Prof. Zachary Dodds and many others for the original implementation of Picobot! 🙌_
