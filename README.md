# Welcome to Picobot++! ü§èüëæ

Picobot++ is an improved version of [Picobot](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/picobot/) from Harvey Mudd College, adding functionality for so-called _hashtag commands_.
Hashtag commands allow for programmatic control of Picobot's environment without having to manually click on each cell.

## New and Improved Features

### Hashtag Commands

#### The Basics

‚û°Ô∏è To add a `Wall` cell at row `X` and column `Y`, use the following command:
```
# add (X,Y)
```
‚û°Ô∏è To delete a `Wall` cell at row `X` and column `Y`, use the following command:
```
# sub (X,Y)
```

#### Star Commands

There are also special _star_ commands, a subset of the hashtag commands. These commands allow you to draw and delete entire lines on the grid.

‚≠ê To add a line of `Wall` cells on row `X`, use the following command:
```
# add (X,*)
```
To delete a line on row `X`, use the same command, replacing `add` with `sub`.

‚≠ê To add a line of `Wall` cells on column `Y`, use the following command:
```
# add (*,Y)
```
To delete a line on column `Y`, use the same command, replacing `add` with `sub`.

_(You can think of the `*` as "anything", taking inspiration from RegExes :))_

On that note, you can fill the whole grid like this:
```
# add (*,*)
```
Or delete the whole grid with this:
```
# sub (*,*)
```

#### Dyna Commands

In addition to star commands, there are also _dyna_ commands! Dyna commands allow for _dynamic_ walls.
To add a dynamic cell on row `X`, column `Y` to Picobot's world, use the following command:
```
# add (X,Y) DYNA
```
However, you can also alter the duration that the cell appears and disappear by using certain flags, in addition to when the cell shows up. If you want to set the duration to be `A` and the offset to be `B`, use the following command:
```
# add (X,Y) DYNA d=A o=B
```
Dyna commands also work with lines and grids.
`sub` commands work just like the dyna `add` commands but are inverted.

### Wrap-Around Functionality

Picobot no longer needs any walls at the beginning of every traversal, as it now wraps around once it hits the boundaries of the grid.

## How to Run

To run Picobot++, simply clone the respository using `git clone` and open up the `html` file. We hope you'll have fun guiding Picobot through even weirder, more bizarre worlds! üéâ
